## RAG Architecture: End-to-End System Flow (Reviewed by Rishi, Sandeep, Yogi)

---

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the finalized architecture, flow, and subsystem responsibilities of the RAG-based analytics query assistant for OpenObserve, based on outputs from planning and requirements phase artifacts. The system separates concerns across local schema lookup, example-based retrieval, query generation, and fallback handling.

---

## 2. High-Level Flow

### User Interaction

1. User submits a natural language query (e.g., "What is the ATC error rate on search page?")
2. The system embeds the query and routes it to a Milvus-backed RAG:
   - **RAG: SQL + VRL Example Index**

> ‚úÖ Schema metadata is resolved via structured `schemaIndex` lookups  
> ‚úÖ RAG handles dashboard-aligned query examples

### Retrieval

3. Top `k` chunks are retrieved from RAG with cosine similarity scoring.
4. Each chunk includes metadata (e.g., `page_nm`, `field`, `metric`, `has_vrl`)
5. A post-RAG **composite scoring layer** refines relevance:

```ts
rag_score = cosine_similarity + (index_match ? 0.1 : 0) - token_overlap_penalty;
````

6. **Example Query RAG**

   * Top **3** example queries are always injected into the prompt.

7. **Schema Resolution**

   * Fields used in retrieved examples or inferred from user prompt are resolved from `schemaIndex`.
   * If multiple candidate fields match, field tags and top values guide selection.

### Prompt Construction

8. Prompt is assembled with distinct sections:

   * **User Intent**
   * **Schema Metadata** (from `schemaIndex`)
   * **Example Queries** (from RAG)
   * **System Instructions** (e.g., rewrite query using `page_nm = 'search'`)

### LLM Response

9. LLM generates a grounded **SQL + VRL query** aligned to user intent. Both are always generated.
10. Output is checked for:

    * Correct field substitution
    * Valid syntax
    * Schema alignment

### Output Handling

11. Response is:

    * Shown to user with inline metadata tags and confidence note
    * Logged for telemetry, fallback tracking, and example refinement

---

## 3. System Components

### üîπ Milvus Collections (RAG Layer)

* `example_query_rag` (only)

Each uses:

* Custom chunking strategy
* Field-specific metadata tagging
* Cosine similarity
* Independent scoring thresholds
* Composite score reranker (as above)

### üîπ Schema Index

* Schema metadata (field name, description, tags, types, usage) is stored in a structured, queryable `schemaIndex` object.
* Queried synchronously to:

  * Validate fields used in prompts or retrieved examples
  * Fetch types, top values, dashboard usage
  * Assist in disambiguation and field substitution

### üîπ RAG Orchestrator

* Embeds query once
* Queries `example_query_rag`
* Resolves field metadata from `schemaIndex`
* Applies composite scoring
* Builds final prompt with top 3 examples + schema metadata

### üîπ Prompt Generator

* Strict prompt scaffolding using template blocks
* Separates schema vs. example contexts
* Injects safety instructions ("do not copy if page mismatch")
* Tracks `prompt_id`, `included_chunks`, and `token_budget`
* **Always generates both SQL and VRL**

### üîπ Validator

* Checks for field substitution accuracy
* Validates presence of requested `page_nm`, `metric`
* Flags hallucinations or mismatches for feedback ingestion

### üîπ UI Layer (Yogi)

* States: success, fallback, partial match, no match
* Confidence score pill + explanation
* Previewable natural-language summary and raw SQL

---

## 4. Edge-Case Handling

* **No match from schemaIndex** ‚Üí use fallback template + expose schema hints
* **Too many matches from example RAG** ‚Üí rank by overlap + cap tokens
* **Substitution mismatch** ‚Üí tag as `low-confidence` and prompt user
* **Unrecognized fields** ‚Üí fallback UI suggestion + log for analyst triage

---

## 5. Future Considerations

* üîç Define PromptTemplate DSL to standardize construction
* üß™ Build test harness to simulate RAG + LLM flow for correctness validation
* üìâ Instrument LLM success/failure with feedback hooks and telemetry
* üóÇÔ∏è Handle schema evolution with versioning, conflict flags, and reloadable schemaIndex
* ‚öñÔ∏è Add source prioritization for duplicated schema fields

---

## 6. Feedback Loop Integration

### üîπ Feedback Capture Points

| Point in Flow            | Mechanism                            |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| After LLM response       | Thumbs up/down + optional comment UI |
| On wrong query detection | User tags incorrect field or page    |
| From analyst review      | Manual tagging of mismatches         |

### üîπ Feedback Types

| Type              | Target Component      | Action                                 |
| ----------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Field mismatch    | schemaIndex lookup    | Flag metadata for correction           |
| Incorrect SQL     | Example RAG           | Mark sample for retraining or deletion |
| Prompt failure    | Prompt template logic | Adjust fallback scaffolding            |
| Repeated fallback | Retrieval engine      | Lower threshold or re-chunk examples   |

### üîπ Processing & Routing

1. Feedback written to `feedback_events` table or queue

2. Events are periodically aggregated into:

   * **Misfire logs** (e.g. top recurring failure fields)
   * **Schema patch list**
   * **Retrieval rule refinements**

3. Analyst or auto-cron reviews apply updates:

   * Patch field metadata
   * Re-tag examples
   * Tune example chunk scoring logic

### üîπ Impact on System Behavior

* Improves future retrieval relevance
* Reduces hallucination recurrence
* Enables "learning from user signals" loop without retraining the LLM

## 7. Schema Field Definition

### üîπ Source of Truth

Schema fields are loaded from structured schema files (e.g., OpenObserve API schema, analytics logs, OpenAPI spec). Each field includes:

* `field_name`: The canonical name used to reference the field in queries and prompts.
* `description`: A plain-language explanation of what the field represents or calculates.
* `field_type`: Indicates whether the field is 'raw' (from source data) or 'derived' (computed).
* `index`: Index in which the field is present
* `base_fields`: For derived fields, lists the raw fields used to compute this one.
* `defined_by`: Specifies how the field is derived, e.g., COALESCE(...) AS upstreamcode
* `visibility`: Controls UI/LLM exposure ‚Äî 'exposed' for user-facing, 'internal' for hidden/internal use.
* `top_values`: Common or most frequent values for the field, useful for matching or substitution.
* `tags`: Functional tags (e.g., error\_signal, analytics, performance)
* `field_frequency_score`: Frequency score based on usage across queries

### üîπ Access Format

All fields are stored in a local lookup structure:

```ts
schemaIndex["upstreamcode"] = {
  field_name: "upstreamcode",
  description: "Returns true if pulsedata_er indicates an out-of-stock event.",
  field_type: "derived",
  index: "walmart_web_analytics",
  base_fields: ["pulsedata_er", "pulsedata_er_ec"],
  defined_by: "COALESCE(...) AS upstreamcode",
  tags: ["performance", "analytics"],
  visibility: "exposed",
  top_values: ["500.CART.1223", "500.CART.400"],
  field_frequency_score: 0.87
}
```

* This replaces all vector-based schema chunking
* Enables deterministic, zero-token-cost schema resolution at runtime
