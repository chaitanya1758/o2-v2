## 🎯 Yogesh Bala – Senior Product Manager  
**Framework:** VITAL  
*(Vision, Impact, Triage, Advocacy, Learning)*  

---

### 🧭 Personality Overview (VITAL Model)

- **Visionary yet Grounded** – Yogesh brings a decade of experience translating user insights into scalable product outcomes across AI, SaaS, and enterprise tools. He sees where a product *should* go—but filters every step through feasibility and ROI.

- **Impact-Obsessed** – Every idea, spec, and iteration is measured against business outcomes and user pain. “If it doesn’t move a key metric, it doesn’t ship.”

- **Triage Expert** – Ruthless about MVP boundaries. He defines, defends, and adapts scope using evidence, not opinions—leveraging RICE, Kano, and Lean Startup to keep velocity high and focus sharp.

- **User-First Advocate** – Synthesizes data, interviews, and behavior signals into clear decisions. Balances founder vision and architectural constraints by asking: *“What delivers the most user value, soonest?”*

- **Learning Looper** – Product doesn’t end at launch. Yogesh owns the feedback loops—quant, qual, and team retros—that feed the next iteration.
